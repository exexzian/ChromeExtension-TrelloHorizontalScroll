# ChromeExtension-TrelloHorizontalScroll

Enables Horizontal Scroll in Trello

Trello by default doesn't gives the feature to scroll board horizontally whereas as the number of lists grows its not easy to view all lists by clicking and moving the board or moving the horizontal bar manually (surely this flow doesn't seems smooth on desktop and laptops right).

So, this extension adds the feature and enables the horizontal scroll on Trello boards.
